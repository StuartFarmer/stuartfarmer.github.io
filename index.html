<p>Me at 16 years old (2010)</p>
<h5>My Story</h5>
<p>I grew up in the Midwest and was exposed to programming at the young age of 6 through my school. After that, I have always been attached to developing software as a form of art and expression and as a way to build a career for myself. I believe that software can be used to liberate and transform society and I try to build software that promotes that idea.</p>

<h5>Abridged Timeline of Events</h5>
<ul>
<li>2000 / Age 6 - Introduction to LOGO programming</li>
<li>2004 / Age 10 - BASIC programming through summer camp, top-of-class award.</li>
<li>2006 / Age 12 - Built an esoteric toy programming language (<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/TapeBagel">TapeBagel</a>) with C++. This esolang later got featured in Internetwache CTF 2016 as a challenge (see <a href="https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2016/tree/master/internetwache-ctf-2016/reversing/eso-tape-80">here</a>)</li>
<li>2007 / Age 13 - More C++ and C# programming, specifically GUI development</li>
<li>2010 / Age 16 - Introduction to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Built mining rigs for various altcoins such as DogeCoin.</li>
<li>2013 / Age 19 - Learned Objective-C to develop iPhone applications and to start my own start-up in college. Worked at the Technology Commercialization Office at Ohio State University (now defunct) building MVPs for researchers looking to commercialize their findings. Worked mostly in XCode, but also did a bit of OpenCV stuff and pushed jobs to supercomputers in the area.</li>
<li>2015 / Age 21 - Started my first business with my coworker developing mobile applications for startups. We partnered with Rev1 Ventures in Columbus, Ohio to offer services to new entrepreneurs. One of our main clients was a group of mothers who wanted to build the 'Uber for babysitting.' We build the version 1 which is still in use <a href="http://www.whyjuggle.com/">today</a>.</li>
<li>2017 / Age 23 - With the cryptocurrency wave, I was able to found my second company <a href="https://github.com/lamden">Lamden</a> which was a Layer-1 blockchain built completely in Python. I led the company into developing the first smart contracting system built with 100% compliant Python.</li>
<li>2022 / Age 28 - Came to accept Lamden as a failure after 5 years. Took what I learned to apply to new adventures.</li>
<li>2024 / Age 30 - Currently working on several projects including capital market risk analysis for broker-dealer firms, finding the cross-section between AI and crypto (who isn't looking at this, to be honest), and several other 'bets.'</li>
</ul>
<h5>Other things that happened in between</h5>
<ul>
<li>Various DeFi, NFT, and crypto side projects.</li>
<li>Plenty of hackathons.</li>
<li>Learned machine learning, AI, and linear algebra to predict the stock market. Worked with custom loss functions, Keras, Tensorflow, experiment tracking, you name it. Ran 1000+ experiments, hypotheses, etc. Found alpha, in both the AI and non-AI domains. I continue to develop models and network with other quants to hopefully build out a quant fund one day.</li>
  <li>Lots of music and art.</li>
  
</ul>

<h5>How we can work together</h5>
<p>
I am always open to new opportunities, especially in the financial and AI technology sectors. I am potentially available for consulting on a high level (I don't program for hire). Feel free to connect with me via one of my contacts below.
